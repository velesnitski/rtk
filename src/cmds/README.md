# Command Filter Modules

## Scope

**Command execution and output filtering** — this is the core value RTK delivers. Every module here calls an external CLI tool (`Command::new("some_tool")`), transforms its stdout/stderr to reduce token consumption, and records savings via `core/tracking`.

Owns: all command-specific filter logic, organized by ecosystem (git, rust, js, python, go, dotnet, cloud, system). Cross-ecosystem routing (e.g., `lint_cmd` detecting Python and delegating to `ruff_cmd`) is an intra-component concern.

Does **not** own: the TOML DSL filter engine (that's `core/toml_filter`), hook interception (that's `hooks/`), or analytics dashboards (that's `analytics/`). This component **writes** to the tracking DB; analytics **reads** from it.

Boundary rule: a module belongs here if and only if it executes an external command and filters its output. Infrastructure that serves multiple modules without calling external commands belongs in `core/`.

## When to Write a Rust Module (vs TOML Filter)

Rust modules exist here because they need capabilities TOML filters don't have: parsing structured output (JSON, NDJSON), state machine parsing across phases, injecting CLI flags (`--format json`), cross-command routing, or **flag-aware filtering** — detecting user-requested verbose flags (e.g., `--nocapture`) and adjusting compression accordingly (see [Design Philosophy](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#design-philosophy) and [TOML vs Rust decision table](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#toml-vs-rust-which-one)).

**Ecosystem placement**: Match the command's language/toolchain. Use `system/` for language-agnostic commands. New ecosystem when 3+ related commands justify it.

For the full contribution checklist (including `discover/rules.rs` registration), see [Adding a New Command Filter](#adding-a-new-command-filter) below.

## Purpose
All command-specific filter modules that execute CLI commands and transform their output to minimize LLM token consumption. Each module follows a consistent pattern: execute the underlying command, filter its output through specialized parsers, track token savings, and propagate exit codes.

## Ecosystems

Each subdirectory has its own README with file descriptions, parsing strategies, and cross-command dependencies.

- **[`git/`](git/README.md)** — git, gh, gt, diff — `trailing_var_arg` parsing, gh markdown filtering, gt passthrough
- **[`rust/`](rust/README.md)** — cargo, runner (err/test) — Cargo sub-enum routing, runner dual-mode
- **[`js/`](js/README.md)** — npm, pnpm, vitest, lint, tsc, next, prettier, playwright, prisma — Package manager auto-detection, lint routing, cross-deps with python
- **[`python/`](python/README.md)** — ruff, pytest, mypy, pip — JSON check vs text format, state machine parsing, uv auto-detection
- **[`go/`](go/README.md)** — go test/build/vet, golangci-lint — NDJSON streaming, Go sub-enum pattern
- **[`dotnet/`](dotnet/README.md)** — dotnet, binlog, trx, format_report — DotnetCommands sub-enum, internal helper modules
- **[`cloud/`](cloud/README.md)** — aws, docker/kubectl, curl, wget, psql — Docker/Kubectl sub-enums, JSON forced output
- **[`system/`](system/README.md)** — ls, tree, read, grep, find, wc, env, json, log, deps, summary, format, smart — format_cmd routing, filter levels, language detection
- **[`ruby/`](ruby/README.md)** — rake/rails test, rspec, rubocop — JSON injection pattern, `ruby_exec()` bundle exec auto-detection

## Common Pattern

Every command module follows this structure:

```rust
pub fn run(args: MyArgs, verbose: u8) -> Result<()> {
    let timer = tracking::TimedExecution::start();
    let output = resolved_command("mycmd").args(&args).output().context("Failed to execute mycmd")?;
    let raw = format!("{}\n{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout), String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr));

    let filtered = filter_output(&raw).unwrap_or_else(|e| {
        eprintln!("rtk: filter warning: {}", e);
        raw.clone()  // Fallback to raw on filter failure
    });

    let exit_code = output.status.code().unwrap_or(1);
    if let Some(hint) = tee::tee_and_hint(&raw, "mycmd", exit_code) {
        println!("{}\n{}", filtered, hint);
    } else {
        println!("{}", filtered);
    }

    timer.track("mycmd args", "rtk mycmd args", &raw, &filtered);
    if !output.status.success() { std::process::exit(exit_code); }
    Ok(())
}
```

Six phases: **timer** → **execute** → **filter (with fallback)** → **tee on failure** → **track** → **exit code**. See [core/README.md](../core/README.md#consumer-contracts) for the contracts each phase must honor.

## Token Savings by Category

| Category | Commands | Typical Savings | Strategy |
|----------|----------|----------------|----------|
| Test Runners | vitest, pytest, cargo test, go test, playwright | 90-99% | Show failures only, aggregate passes |
| Build Tools | cargo build, npm, pnpm, dotnet | 70-90% | Strip progress bars, summarize errors |
| VCS | git status/log/diff/show | 70-80% | Compact commit hashes, stat summaries |
| Linters | eslint/biome, ruff, tsc, mypy, golangci-lint | 80-85% | Group by file/rule, strip context |
| Package Managers | pip, cargo install, pnpm list | 75-80% | Remove decorative output, compact trees |
| File Operations | ls, find, grep, cat/head/tail | 60-75% | Tree format, grouped results, truncation |
| Infrastructure | docker, kubectl, aws, terraform | 75-85% | Essential info only |

## Cross-Command Dependencies

- `lint_cmd` routes to `mypy_cmd` or `ruff_cmd` when detecting Python projects
- `format_cmd` routes to `prettier_cmd` or `ruff_cmd` depending on the formatter detected
- `gh_cmd` imports `compact_diff()` from `git` for diff formatting (markdown helpers are defined in `gh_cmd` itself)

## Cross-Cutting Behavior Contracts

These behaviors must be uniform across all command modules. Full audit details in `docs/ISO_ANALYZE.md`.

### Exit Code Propagation

Modules must capture the underlying command's exit code, propagate it via `std::process::exit()` only on failure, and return `Ok(())` on success. When the process is killed by signal (`.code()` returns `None`), default to exit code 1.

### Filter Failure Passthrough

When filtering fails, fall back to raw output and warn on stderr. Never block the user.

### Tee Recovery

Modules that parse structured output (JSON, NDJSON, state machines) must call `tee::tee_and_hint()` so users can recover full output on failure.

### Stderr Handling

Modules must capture stderr and include it in the raw string passed to `timer.track()`, so token savings reflect total output.

### Tracking Completeness

All modules must call `timer.track()` on every path — success, failure, and fallback. Never exit before tracking.

### Verbose Flag

All modules accept `verbose: u8`. Use it to print debug info (command being run, savings %, filter tier). Do not accept and ignore it.

### Gaps (to be fixed)

**Exit code** — 5 different patterns coexist, should be reviewed for uniform behavior:
- `vitest_cmd.rs`, `tsc_cmd.rs`, `psql_cmd.rs` — exit unconditionally, even on success
- `lint_cmd.rs` — swallows signal kills silently
- `golangci_cmd.rs` — maps signal kill to exit 130 (correct but unique)

**Filter passthrough** — silent passthrough, no warning:
- `gh_cmd.rs`, `pip_cmd.rs`, `container.rs`, `dotnet_cmd.rs` — `run_passthrough()` skips filtering without warning
- `pnpm_cmd.rs` — 3-tier degradation but no tee recovery on final tier

**Tee recovery** — missing from some high-risk modules:
- `pnpm_cmd.rs` — 3-tier parser, no tee
- `gh_cmd.rs` — aggressive markdown filtering, no tee
- `ruff_cmd.rs`, `golangci_cmd.rs` — JSON parsers, no tee
- `psql_cmd.rs` — has tee but exits before calling it on error path

**Stderr handling** — 3 patterns coexist. Some modules combine stderr into raw (correct), others print via `eprintln!()` and exclude from tracking (inflates savings %). See `docs/ISO_ANALYZE.md` section 4.

**Tracking** — exit before track on error path:
- `ls.rs`, `tree.rs` — lost metrics on failure
- `container.rs` — inconsistent across subcommands

**Verbose** — accept parameter but ignore it:
- `container.rs` — all internal functions prefix `_verbose`
- `diff_cmd.rs` — `_verbose` unused

## Adding a New Command Filter

Adding a new filter or command requires changes in multiple places:

1. **Create the filter** — TOML file in [`src/filters/`](../filters/README.md) or Rust module in `src/cmds/<ecosystem>/`
2. **Add rewrite pattern** — Entry in `src/discover/rules.rs` (PATTERNS + RULES arrays at matching index) so hooks auto-rewrite the command
3. **Register in main.rs** — (Rust modules only) Three changes:
   - Add `pub mod mymod;` to the ecosystem's `mod.rs` (e.g., `src/cmds/system/mod.rs`)
   - Add variant to `Commands` enum in `main.rs` with `#[arg(trailing_var_arg = true, allow_hyphen_values = true)]`
   - Add routing match arm in `main.rs` to call `mymod::run()`
4. **Write tests** — Real fixture, snapshot test, token savings >= 60% (see [testing rules](../../.claude/rules/cli-testing.md))
5. **Update docs** — README.md command list, CHANGELOG.md

Follow the [Common Pattern](#common-pattern) above for the module template (timer, fallback, tee, tracking, exit code). For TOML-vs-Rust decision criteria, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#toml-vs-rust-which-one).
